# Poor man's party light (serverles)

Do you want to host a party with cool lights, but you don't have enough money (or time) to set up a light system? Well with this new `poor man's party light` you will be able to set up your personal light system using your computer (or even tablet or mobile phone) monitors.

# They all are synced!

The color is based on the time and unless your devices differ in time for many seconds averything should be on sync.

# It can't hear music

Unfortunately this script is too poor to have a mic, so all animations are static and independent from the beat which is playing. Maybe next update will implement microphone compatibility.

# How to use

Just open `index.html` on any computer you have.
